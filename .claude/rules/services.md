# Service Conventions

- Design services around a single responsibility
- Use the `providedIn: 'root'` option for singleton services
- Prefer the `@Service` decorator over `@Injectable({providedIn: 'root'})` for new singleton services (Angular v22+)
- Use the `inject()` function instead of constructor injection
